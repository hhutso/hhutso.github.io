                        I started rock climbing in the spring of 2024. So far I have only done indoor/gym climbing, but soon I hope to go rock climbing outdoors.
                        I have competed in 2 climbing competitions on campus, the top-rope competition and the bouldering competition. I placed 2nd in the beginner
                        category at the bouldering competition and I got a certificate! I hope to continue to compete and be able to solve more complex climbing problems.

                        I have played video games as a hobby since I was a kid, but the types of games that I enjoy has evolved as I have grown. When I started playing
                        video games, I loved all of the Lego video games with Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga being my favorite. As I got into Middle and High School,
                        I played more multiplayer based video games with my friends like GTA Online, Dead by Daylight, and Minecraft. Now that I am in college and working 
                        I do not have as much time or energy to play video games but when I do, I like to play single-player story-based games. Some of my favorites are 
                        the Last of Us series, Spider-Man, Resident Evil, and Skyrim.

                        During the pandemic, I enjoyed watching new movies all of the time. Now that the theaters are open again, I try to see at least one new movie a month, 
                        but when I have more free time, I will often see at least 2 or 3 a month. I like being exposed to new art and differing perspectives, all of which movies 
                        provide. I also love movie soundtracks, so that is another reason why I love watching new movies. My 4 favorites on Letterboxd currently are Star 
                        Wars: Revenge of the Sith, The Batman, Nope, and Mamma Mia.
