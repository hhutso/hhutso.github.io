                <p class="project-subtitle">ThoughtBubble aims to turn screen time into family time! Families these days are not as close as they used to be, whether by distance or by difference in communication styles. Everyone is on a device but it is not being used to further develop family dynamics. ThoughtBubble will allow families to display how they are feeling and set a status (i.e. how open they are to talk) in an effort to bring them closer together using technology.</p>

                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>ThoughtBubble is a family communication application that helps you to communicate your emotions with family. Have you ever had a super bad day and are not in the mood to be bothered by your family when you get home? Ever had a really good day at work or school and are eager to talk about it? Or how about if you just need a hug? ThoughtBubble allows you to do all of this without having to directly confront your family members or have the tough conversations that come with talking about your emotions.</p>
                    <p>Many families are separated, for jobs, military service, or school, so being able to communicate where their head is at can be difficult. ThoughtBubble is not limited to strictly families, but can also be used among friends or close-knit groups as well. Have you ever needed to remember birthdays, important events, or celebrations coming up in the lives of your loved ones without having to ask or possibly having to shamefully admit that you forgot? ThoughtBubble will allow you to keep track of all of these important life events along with the emotional needs of those you love in one simple place.</p>
